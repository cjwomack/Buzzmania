An interview with James William Pye
```
. Tell us which existing OSI-approved license is most similar
. to your license. [...]

The license is similar to the BSD license.
The BSD license seems to imply a requirement of, what I call, Due Credit.
Although, I wanted an explicit specification of Due Credit within my license.
I also thought it more appropriate to use terms such as 'works' instead of 'source'
to not be specific as to what was covered by the license within the license(Would this matter in a trial?).
The Fair License is mainly a generalized BSD license(terminology-wise) with
an explicit requirement of Due Credit by the retention and notification of the instrument.
```

This is similar to the Simplified BSD license (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses#2-clause_license_(%22Simplified_BSD_License%22_or_%22FreeBSD_License%22))
